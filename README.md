# E-commerce Sales Analysis Project

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore and analyze the sales trends, patterns, and profitability factors of an e-commerce business over the span of one year. Using real sales data, I will investigate how different variables such as product categories, pricing, commission rates, and city-based orders influence of my Trendyol e-commerce shop's overall performance. The ultimate goal is to derive actionable insights to optimize sales strategies, improve profitability, and enhance customer targeting.

By utilizing data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques, the project will answer critical business questions and forecast future trends, providing a data-driven roadmap for growth.

- **Product Name:** Name of the sold product.  
- **Brand:** The brand of the product.  
- **Category:** The category to which the product belongs.  
- **Order Quantity:** The quantity of products ordered.  
- **Order Amount:** Total revenue generated from the order.  
- **Order Date and Season:** The date and season when the order was placed.


## Tools and Technologies

The following tools and technologies will be used for data analysis and visualization:

- **Python:** For data processing and analysis.  
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.  
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For creating visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, trend lines).  
- **Scikit-learn:** For potential predictive modeling and trend analysis.  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For documenting the data exploration and insights.

## Analysis Plan

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Import the dataset and handle missing or inconsistent data.  
   - Convert dates to datetime format and categorize price ranges if necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze sales trends over time, segmented by months and seasons.  
   - Visualize the distribution of sales across different cities and product categories.  
   - Identify top-performing products and cities.  
   - Assess the impact of price ranges on sales volume.

3. **Profitability and Commission Analysis**  
   - Calculate the net revenue after commissions.  
   - Identify products and categories that yield the highest profitability.  
   - Analyze which commission rates result in the best margins.

4. **Seasonality and Forecasting**  
   - Identify seasonal trends in sales and determine peak periods.  
   - Forecast future sales using simple statistical models.

5. **Visualization and Reporting**  
   - Create detailed visualizations to support each analysis point.  
   - Summarize key insights and recommendations.

## üîç Analysis and Machine Learning
1. **Sales Trend Analysis**: Monthly and seasonal trends visualized using line plots and pie charts.
2. **Category and Seasonal Analysis**: Identified top-selling product categories across seasons.
3. **Logistic Regression ‚Äì High vs Low Sales Classification**:
   - Predicted whether a sales record would be high or low based on month, season, and category.
   - Achieved **77% accuracy**, with strong low-sales prediction performance.
4. **Random Forest Regression ‚Äì Sales Quantity Prediction**:
   - Predicted continuous **net sales quantity** (`Net Sats Adedi`).
   - Achieved **MAE of 96.84** and **R¬≤ score of 0.79**.
5. **Result of ML Tasks**:
   - Logistic Regression classified sales records (binary: high/low).
   - Random Forest predicted continuous net sales quantity.
   - Key insights highlighted and suggestions for future improvements (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering).

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, we aim to answer key business questions such as:

- Which seasons and cities drive the highest sales?  
- Which product categories and price ranges are the most profitable?  
- How do commission rates impact overall profitability?  
- What strategic adjustments can be made to maximize future sales and revenue?

The insights derived from this analysis will not only help optimize current strategies but will also provide a strong foundation for data-driven decision-making in future business planning.
